  – & –    & ob   & If the oboes play unison with the violins and a chord
                    appears in the violin part, only a singgle note is retained
                    for the oboe part (typically, the highest note in ob 1
                    and a suitable lower note in ob 2). \\

                    readily be omitted. \\
